                            Begin by sitting on a flat bench. Hold the dumbbell at your side with an overhand grip.
                            Tighten
                            your core and flatten your back.<br><br>
                            Bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height so that your palm are facing you. Push the
                            dumbbells
                            overhead. Rotate them as you do so.
                            At the height of the movement, your palms should be facing away from you. Pause, contract
                            and
                            slowly return to the starting point through the same rotation. This exercise can also be
                            done on
                            the sofa with bottles of water.

                            Stairs are generally readily available. Those who run for exercise generally prefer to have
                            a
                            span of distance over which they may travel. Stairs, on the other hand, are readily
                            available in
                            apartments, office buildings, on streets and in public areas.<br><br>

                            Stairs are “compact.” Those who prefer stair climbing to running simply need an ordinary
                            staircase for their workout. In fact, all buildings that have elevators also have stairs.
                            Those
                            who prefer to stair climb for exercise may opt to take the stairs instead of the elevator
                            when
                            faced with this choice.<br><br>

                            In addition, stair climbing requires no special clothing or equipment. You may want to wear
                            comfortable workout clothes and shoes, but even if you are not dressed for a workout, you
                            can
                            still reap the aerobic and fat-burning benefits of stair climbing.

                            Aqua Aerobics classes are a great way to mix up a traditional gym workout with the wondrous
                            benefits of water. It only takes a few aqua aerobics sessions and you’ll see a big
                            difference in
                            your overall fitness.<br><br>

                            Also know as water aerobics or sometimes waterobics, typical classes will involve all the
                            exercises you would expect in a ‘dry’ class. But there are added bonuses when you exercise
                            in
                            water.

                            The pushup may just be the perfect exercise that builds both upper-body and core strength.
                            Done
                            properly, it is a compound exercise that uses muscles in the chest, shoulders, triceps,
                            back,
                            abs, and even the legs.<br><br>

                            It has many modifications so beginners can start with easier versions and work up to the
                            standard pushup, while you can find a challenging variation if you are advanced. You can do
                            the
                            pushup as part of a bodyweight exercise session, a circuit training workout, or a strength
                            workout.<br><br>

                            The upper body muscles that come into play in the pushup are the deltoids of the shoulders,
                            the
                            pectoral muscles of the chest, the triceps and biceps of the upper arm, and the erector
                            spinae
                            of the back. The abdominal muscles used to hold the body rigid during the pushup are the
                            rectus
                            abdominis and the transversus abdominis. As the pushup involves multiple joints, it is a
                            compound exercise.

                            You may have heard of people doing Spinning Classes or Spin Classes and wondered what
                            exactly it
                            means. First of all, since “Spinning” refers specifically to the company, Spinning classes
                            mean
                            classes put on or licensed by Mad Dogg Athletics, the company that created the Spinning
                            program.
                            <br><br>
                            You can definitely get a great workout at home on a Spin bike of your own (check here for
                            the
                            best Spin Bikes for home), but it’s also great to workout in a class environment where there
                            is
                            a sense of team effort and group motivation. When you’re by yourself it’s hard to truly push
                            yourself as you’re the only one there to keep you accountable. But if you’re in a class then
                            you
                            have the other participants, as well as the teacher, constantly watching over you which will
                            give you more drive. For anyone looking in on a class it almost looks torturous: loud music
                            blaring through the speakers, an assertive class leader shouting at people to go harder and
                            a
                            group of people sweating buckets from every part of their body. However, once you start
                            you’ll
                            never go back. So let’s get specific about what you can expect from a Spinning Class.
